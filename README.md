## Installation

TODO: Describe the installation process

## Usage

* Download the [ZIP-file](https://github.com/niebert/eProofDoc/archive/master.zip) and unzip in your Documents folder.
* Install [eProofJS](https://github.com/niebert/eProofJS) if you want to create your own e-Proofs as an author (teacher or lecturer in Mathematics).
* If you save HTML-files with eProofElectron these files need 4 libraries in the folder `libraries`. So if you copy e-Proofs to another location on you filesystem or on a webserver please ensure that the exported HTML-file  has the library-folder in the same directory.
