# eProofDoc
eProofJS Support Files for your Document Folder

It allows

## Installation

* Download the [eProofDoc ZIP-file](https://github.com/niebert/eProofDoc/archive/master.zip) and unzip in your Documents folder and rename the folder `eProofDoc`.
* Download the [PanDoc ZIP-file](https://github.com/niebert/PanDoc/archive/master.zip) and unzip in your Documents folder and rename the folder `PanDoc`.
* Install [eProofJS](https://github.com/niebert/eProofJS) if you want to create your own e-Proofs as an author (teacher or lecturer in Mathematics).

## Usage

* Please save HTML-files with eProofElectron these files need 4 libraries in the folder `eProofDoc/libraries`. So if you copy e-Proofs to another location on you filesystem or on a webserver please ensure that the exported HTML-file  has the library-folder in the same directory.  
* Install PanDoc-Support Files


## Contributing

2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

* The files are generated along with the Javascript Environment eProofJS as a pilot.
The project needs a refactoring of the code. All generated e-Proofs stored as XML-file can be parsed with the refactored eProofJS.

* Due to a standalone Environment of eProofJS the generated HTML-Export does not need the Electron Environment of eProofElectron. Students only need the 4 libraries.

* Furthermore this repository contains some example e-Proofs that can serve as a starting point for other lecturers or teachers to create their own e-Proofs tailored to the requirements and constraints of
